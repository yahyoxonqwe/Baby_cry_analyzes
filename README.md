# Baby_cry_analyzes
Crying is the primary means of communication between the baby and the outside world. 
When a baby is crying, it is difficult for a novice parent to understand the baby’s needs immediately. If parents can accurately determine the cause of the baby’s cry, they can understand the baby’s emotional and physiological changes and needs.
